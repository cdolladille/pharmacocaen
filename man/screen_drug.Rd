\usage{
screen_drug(.data, mp_data, freq_threshold = NULL, top_n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{data.table} containing drug data,
including columns \code{DrecNo} for drug identifiers and \code{UMCReportId}
for unique report identifiers.}

\item{mp_data}{An MP \code{data.table} containing \code{DrecNo} and \code{drug_name} mappings.}

\item{freq_threshold}{A numeric value indicating the minimum
frequency (as a proportion) of cases where a drug must appear
to be included in the results. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer specifying the number of most frequently occurring drugs to return. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \verb{Drug name}: The drug name.
\item \code{DrecNo}: The drug record number
\item \code{N}: The number of unique reports (cases) where the drug appears.
\item \code{percentage}: The percentage of total unique reports
where the drug appears.
}
The results are sorted in descending order of \code{percentage}.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}
The \code{screen_drug()} function identifies and ranks the most frequently
reported drugs (by active ingredient) in a dataset.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If \code{freq_threshold} is set (e.g., \code{0.05}), the function filters
drugs appearing in at least 5\% of unique reports in \code{.data}.
\item If \code{top_n} is specified, only the most frequent \code{n} drugs are returned.
If both \code{freq_threshold} and \code{top_n} are provided, only \code{top_n} is
applied (a warning is raised in such cases).
\item Counts are computed at the \emph{case} level, not the drug mention level.
This means frequencies reflect the proportion of unique
reports (cases) where a drug is mentioned, rather than the total
mentions across all reports.
}
}
\examples{
# Filter drugs appearing in at least 10\% of reports
screen_drug(
  .data = drug_,
  mp_data = mp_,
  freq_threshold = 0.10
)

# Get the top 5 most reported drugs
screen_drug(
  .data = drug_,
  mp_data = mp_,
  top_n = 5
)

# nb: in the example datasets, not all drugs are recorded in mp_,
# leading to NAs in screen_drug output.
}
