The goal of vigicaen is to provide tools to analyze VigiBase Extract Case Level.

VigiBase is the World Health Organization's (WHO) global pharmacovigilance database 
of individual case safety reports. It is maintained by the Uppsala
Monitoring Centre in Sweden.

> This package is **NOT** supported nor reflect the opinion of the WHO, or the
Uppsala Monitoring Centre.

## Prerequisites

Users are assumed to be familiar with pharmacovigilance analysis principles.
Some useful resources can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.02.022)
(English) or [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2019.01.006) (French).

vigicaen is a R package, so you need to have R installed on your computer, and
optionally RStudio.

Use of VigiBase Extract Case Level and the subsequent WHODrug data requires 
a license from the [Uppsala Monitoring Centre](https://who-umc.org/).

Use of MedDRA requires a license from [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/).

Of note, academic researchers are provided with accommodations for these licenses.

## Target users

There are 2 types of users this package is aimed at:

-    Routine pharmacovigilance practitioners. These users may not be 
very familiar with R, or statistics in general. They would like to 
collect additional data, when writing pharmacovigilance reports, or working
on a reported case. These users will be interested in the "Routine pharmacovigilance"
vignette, `vignette("routine_pharmacovigilance")`.

-    Advanced pharmacovigilance researchers. These users must be familiar
with R and (a bit of) statistics. The will find tools to load tables,
perform usual data management, identify drug and reaction IDs,
describe complexe features, perform disproportionality, and get ready-to-use
datasets to apply any regression or machine learning algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vigicaen from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

> `devtools::install_github("pharmacologie-caen/vigicaen")`

### Solution 2

Look at the **Releases** panel on the right of the Github page. 
You may find "vX.XX.X (Latest)".

Click on the version you want to install.

Download source code as a tar.gz file.

If you use RStudio, click on "Tools", "Install Packages...", select 
"Package Archive file" and locate the tar.gz file on your computer.

Alternatively, you can use the following command in R:

`install.packages("path/to/vigicaen_X.XX.X.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")`


## How to use

> Visit the [package website](https://pharmacologie-caen.github.io/vigicaen/)

## Example

Say you want to perform a disproportionality analysis between nivolumab exposure
and colitis reporting.
You may want to use `add_drug()`, `add_adr()`, and `compute_or_abcd()`.

```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(vigicaen)

demo <-
  demo_ |> 
  add_drug(
    d_code = ex_$d_drecno,
    drug_data = drug_
  ) |> 
  add_adr(
    a_code = ex_$a_llt,
    adr_data = adr_
  )

demo |> 
  compute_or_abcd(
    y = "a_colitis",
    x = "nivolumab"
  )
```

<!-- Footnote for myself

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
